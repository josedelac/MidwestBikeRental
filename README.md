Bike rental simulator

This is a Windows Forms application built in Visual Studio which simulates a bike rental station. It allows the user to select the type and brand of bike they would like to rent for an hourly charge. It calculates the total based on their selections and has a checkout form at the end. This is the 2nd version as I redid the whole interface to make it more modern and user friendly. I am currently looking to add more features to it.
